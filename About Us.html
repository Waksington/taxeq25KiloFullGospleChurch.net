    <p style="text-align: left; color: gold">The Ethiopian Full Gospel Believer's Church emerged out of the spontaneous gospel revival among students of higher institutions in various parts of the country by the mid 1965s. In those successive years the revival broke throughout the country. Since then, the revival inundated the whole country the provincial towns, small towns and villages in the countryside. This brought the issue that the believers had to form unity on a national level and be organized as a denomination. In 1974, leaders from different places of the country came and agreed to be organized at a denominational level. Organizing the denomination had many advantages; among those are, it enabled to guard against false teaching/heresy/ and the other was to obtain recognition by the government and other denominations. Besides these, the unity had contributed in holding common understanding of doctrine, as well the believers were able to encourage and help one another during years of hardship. With the change of the government in Ethiopia came new chapter of the church. The national office of the church is established in Addis Ababa and the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia accorded the church its full recognition on November 10, 1991 in accordance with the constitutional provision of the religious liberty and freedom of worship.</p>
